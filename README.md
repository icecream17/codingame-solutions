# codingame-solutions

My solutions to problems on codingame.com

The structure of this repo is based on
<https://github.com/pathosDev/CodinGame-Solutions>.

In folder names, I use the link, i.e. `the-descent` not `The Descent` for the
puzzle at <https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent>.

And `Very Hard` becomes `expert`.

I show all my solutions in various languages and in chronological order.

For example, `go.go` is my first go solution.
`js3.js` would be my third js solution.

Most solutions were made years ago and my coding is very sloppy. But feel free
to add an issue and request a better solution.

## Notes to self

`.cpp` is the c++ extension.

Make sure the score is 100%.

`breach` has an amazing solution (by MistyPhi).
I just love the aesthetic of single line fullwidth comments.
