# codingame-solutions

My solutions to problems on codingame.com

The structure of this repo is based on
<https://github.com/pathosDev/CodinGame-Solutions>.

In folder names, I use the link, i.e. `the-descent` not `The Descent` for the
puzzle at <https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent>.

And the `Very Hard` difficulty becomes `expert`.

I show all my solutions in various languages and in chronological order.

For example, `go.go` is my first go solution.
`js3.js` would be my third js solution.

Most solutions were made years ago and my coding is very sloppy. But feel free
to add an issue and request a better solution. If a solution is made by someone
else, that is indicated with `-by-[username]` in the filename.

## Notes to self

`.cpp` is the c++ extension.

Make sure the score is 100%.

`breach` has an amazing solution (by MistyPhi).
I just love the aesthetic of single line fullwidth comments.

## Stats

| Difficulty | Count |
|------------|------:|
| Easy       | 28    |
| Medium     | 10    |
| Hard       | 3     |
| Expert     | 2     |

Personally I think the community success rate is a better indicator of
difficulty than the classification. Though at this point I think I can
easily solve all easy puzzles, so I won't do any more.
